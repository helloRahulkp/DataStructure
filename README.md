# DataStructure
📚 Data Structures Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures Repository, a comprehensive collection of core computer science data structures implemented in C, Java, and Python. This repo is designed to help learners and developers understand the concepts, implementations, and time complexities of fundamental data structures across multiple programming languages.

⸻

🗂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories, each containing language-specific implementations:

Data Structure/
│
├── C/          # C language implementations of data structures
│
├── Java/       # Java implementations, including generic usage and object-oriented design
│
└── Python/     # Python implementations with clean, modular code


🛠 How to Use
	1.	Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/helloRahulkp/DataStructure.git
    2.	Navigate to your preferred language folder:
        cd DataStructure/C      # for C
        cd DataStructure/Java   # for Java
        cd DataStructure/Python # for Python
    3.	Compile/run the code:
	•	C: gcc filename.c -o output && ./output
	•	Java: javac Filename.java && java Filename
	•	Python: python3 filename.py

🤝 Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to:
	•	Add more data structure implementations.
	•	Improve existing code or add unit tests.
	•	Submit documentation improvements or tutorials.
